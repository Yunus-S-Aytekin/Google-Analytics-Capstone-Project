# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

- I created this repository for __Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study__ course on Coursera.
- In this scenario, I need to perform data analysis for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.
- I need to analyze smart device data to understand how consumers use their smart devices.

### Data Source

- I used the second case study dataset for my case study.
- The link to the dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)
